# OpenTransit State API

API for historical transit vehicle location data.

OpenTransit State API provides a GraphQL API for the data previously stored in S3 by OpenTransit Collector (https://github.com/codeforpdx/opentransit-collector).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo.

2. Create a docker-compose.override.yml file that sets the environment variable OPENTRANSIT_S3_BUCKET to the name of the S3 bucket where data was stored by OpenTransit Collector, and provides AWS credentials with read access to that bucket. The OpenTransit State API reads data from S3 using the AWS credentials from the default locations,
e.g. a credentials file located within the Docker container at /root/.aws/credentials (using the default profile or a profile named by AWS_PROFILE),
or using the environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. For example:

```
version: "3.7"
services:
  state-api-dev:
    volumes:
      - ../.aws:/root/.aws
    environment:
      AWS_PROFILE: "default"
      OPENTRANSIT_S3_BUCKET: "my-opentransit-bucket"
```

2. Run `docker-compose up`

The GraphQL API will be available at http://localhost:4000/graphql .

## API Documentation

### Query

The root query object for the API.

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `state` | [`[AgencyState]`](#agencystate) | Returns historical state of vehicles for a particular transit agency. |

#### Parameters for `state`

| Parameter Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agency` | `String!` | ID of the agency. The agency ID should be the same ID used in the configuration for OpenTransit Collector. |
| `startTime` | `BigInt!` | Start timestamp in seconds since the Unix epoch. |
| `endTime` | `BigInt!` | End timestamp in seconds since the Unix epoch , exclusive. |
| `routes` | `[String!]` | List of route IDs to return vehicle data. |

### AgencyState

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agencyId` | `String` | ID of the agency. The agency ID should be the same ID used in the configuration for OpenTransit Collector. |
| `startTime` | `BigInt` | Start timestamp in seconds since the Unix epoch. |
| `endTime` | `BigInt` | End timestamp in seconds since the Unix epoch, exclusive. |
| `routes` | [`[RouteHistory]`](#routehistory) | Array of historical state for each route. |

### RouteHistory

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `routeId` | `String` | ID of the route. |
| `states` | [`[RouteState]`](#routestate) | Array of historical data for this route. |

### RouteState

State of a particular route at a particular time.

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `timestamp` | `BigInt` | Timestamp when vehicle data was retrieved, in seconds since the Unix epoch. |
| `vehicles` | [`[VehicleState]`](#vehiclestate) | Array of vehicles observed at this timestamp. |

### VehicleState

State of a particular vehicle at a particular time. Some fields may be null if not provided by the data source.

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vid` | `String` | ID of this vehicle. |
| `did` | `String` | ID of the direction the vehicle reported it was going. |
| `lat` | `Float` | Reported latitude of vehicle. |
| `lon` | `Float` | Reported longitude of vehicle. |
| `heading` | `Float` | Reported heading of vehicle in degrees. |
| `secsSinceReport` | `Int` | Number of seconds old this observation was when it was retrieved (at `timestamp` of `RouteState`). |
| `numCars` | `Int` | Number of cars in this vehicle. |
| `stopIndex` | `Int` | The index of the current stop in the sequence (GTFS-realtime providers only) |
| `status` | `Int` | 0 if the vehicle is about to arrive at the stop referred to by `stopIndex`, 1 if the vehicle is stopped at this stop, 2 if the vehicle is in transit to this stop (GTFS-realtime providers only) |
| `tripId` | `String` | ID of the trip the vehicle reported it was running (GTFS-realtime providers only) |

## Sample Query

Once you run it, go to http://localhost:4000/graphql in your browser and run this query:

```
query {
  state(agencyId: "muni", startTime: 1572105600, endTime: 1572112800, routes: ["14", "19", "49"]) {
    agencyId
    startTime
    routes {
      routeId
      states {
        timestamp
        vehicles {
          vid
          lat
          lon
          heading
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Substitute startTime and endTime with epoch timestamps (in seconds) corresponding to when OpenTransit Collector was actually running.
